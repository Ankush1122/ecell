                            <p>On 19th July, Board of Innovation & Entrepreneurship at IIT Jodhpur in collaboration with IIC IIT Jodhpur kicked-off it’s ‘Impact Lecture Series’, with the first talk by Mr Rakesh Ranjan Verma, Founder and Director of Elina Energy.</p>
                            <p>An alumnus of IIM Ranchi and BIT Sindri, Mr Verma had over twenty years of experience in the corporate sector before he initiated his entrepreneurial journey by founding Elina Energy.</p>
                            <p>Like a Guru to the budding young entrepreneurs, Mr. Verma was more than happy to share his perspective about how to make sense of the transition from a high paying job to a life of relative uncertainty, from a structured setup to an ever-evolving setup.</p>
                            <p>He explained the source of energy and motivation as also the benefits of making the shift to the world of entrepreneurship. Drawing from his experience with international clients, he highlighted the role of technology in value creation.</p>
                            <p>He also explained how the nature of the challenge has changed from the time he started the venture to today when he has more than 50 employees working for him. Finally, he highlighted the need to foster an inventive attitude to consistently come up with fresh concepts. The talk was a resounding success, with an overflow of an interactive Q&A session!!</p>
                            <p>Mr. Verma instilled a new sense of confidence regarding the corporate world and leaving it to pursue your own ventures. The attendees were incredibly delighted to have received all the important points from Mr. Verma’s invaluable experience.

                            <p>The second talk 19th July brought to us ‘Apni Swadeshi Cycle’, an invention by Mr. Gursaurabh Singh. He is the Founder and creator of Dhruv Vidyut, a company that creates and sells electric conversion kits.
                            <p>Mr. Gursaurabh had a literature background and was pulled into the world of electricals and electronics because of his interest in long nation- wide travels on a racing motorcycle. project.</p> 
                            <p>He is on the cusp of successfully solving one of the biggest problems of rural India by designing and manufacturing an electric energy conversion device for mechanically driven cycles.</p> 
                            <p>It was inspiring to note how Mr Singh went through numerous design iterations to arrive at his product, all during the depression phase of Covid-19. Mr. GurSaurabh’s invention, ‘Apni swadeshi cycle’, has a portable machine which can be charged through electric source as well as by 20 mins of cycling.</p>
                            <p>Having stunning features such as water and fire resistance, lightweight mobile phone charging, ability to handle 170 kg load for over 40 kms etc make it a product of high utility. It was exhilarating to note how his invention has gone viral on social media with leaders like Mr Mahindra, Mr Munjal as also NITI Aayog actively engaging with his invention apart from making his posts viral.</p> 
                             There were also talks regarding the possibility of collaborative work with students of IIT J as the venture works with DRDO to certify the product for mass scale usage.
                                Mr Singh’s talk was received incredibly positively by attendees, who were intrigued and curious about the amazing invention. The attendees were inspired to think creatively when trying to solve the problems that truly matter to the society, and solve actual, ground- reality problems in ingenious ways. The session proved to be inspirational, lively, and vibrant!</div>
