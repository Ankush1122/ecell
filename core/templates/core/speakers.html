                                his perspective about how to make sense of the transition from a high paying job to
                                a
                                life of relative uncertainty, from a structured setup to an ever-evolving setup.</p>
                            <p>He explained the source of energy and motivation as also the benefits of making the

                                started
                                the venture to today when he has more than 50 employees working for him. Finally, he
                                highlighted the need to foster an inventive attitude to consistently come up with
                                fresh
                                concepts. The talk was a resounding success, with an overflow of an interactive Q&A

                            <p>The second talk 19th July brought to us ‘Apni Swadeshi Cycle’, an invention by Mr.
                                Gursaurabh Singh. He is the Founder and creator of Dhruv Vidyut, a company that
                                creates
                                and sells electric conversion kits.
                            <p>Mr. Gursaurabh had a literature background and was pulled into the world of
                                electricals
                                and electronics because of his interest in long nation- wide travels on a racing
                                motorcycle. project.</p>
                            <p>He is on the cusp of successfully solving one of the biggest problems of rural India
                                by
                                designing and manufacturing an electric energy conversion device for mechanically
                                driven
                                cycles.</p>
                            <p>It was inspiring to note how Mr Singh went through numerous design iterations to
                                arrive
                                at his product, all during the depression phase of Covid-19. Mr. GurSaurabh’s
                                invention,
                                ‘Apni swadeshi cycle’, has a portable machine which can be charged through electric
                                source as well as by 20 mins of cycling.</p>
                            <p>Having stunning features such as water and fire resistance, lightweight mobile phone
                                charging, ability to handle 170 kg load for over 40 kms etc make it a product of
                                high
                                utility. It was exhilarating to note how his invention has gone viral on social
                                media
                                with leaders like Mr Mahindra, Mr Munjal as also NITI Aayog actively engaging with
                                his
                                invention apart from making his posts viral.</p>
                            <p>There were also talks regarding the possibility of collaborative work with students of
                            IIT J
                            as the venture works with DRDO to certify the product for mass scale usage.
                            Mr Singh’s talk was received incredibly positively by attendees, who were intrigued and
                            curious about the amazing invention. The attendees were inspired to think creatively
                            when
                            trying to solve the problems that truly matter to the society, and solve actual, ground-
                            reality problems in ingenious ways. The session proved to be inspirational, lively, and

                            <p>On the 30th of July, Board of Innovation & Entrepreneurship at IIT Jodhpur in collaboration with IIC IIT Jodhpur conducted its ‘Impact Lecture Series’, with the first talk of the day by Ms. Umit Bhatia, Vice President - Health, Safety & Sustainable Workplaces Manager of Asia in RBS Business Services Pvt. Ltd.</p>
                            <p>Not only this, but she is also the one who pioneered the set-up of the ESG, and Occupational Health and Safety Department in Natwest India in 2015. She keeps a keen interest in Climate change and Innovation. She is known in the industry for her leadership skill, she is a great strategic planner and enterprise-wide risk manager. She has a versatile personality and has a diverse career path. She is also a solo artist trained in Hindustani classical music and a member of mentor and mascot Indian film federation.</p>
                            <p>Ms. Bhatia started by sharing her career journey and how she transitioned into completely different careers. Then she went on to discuss the climate changes happening around and how an individual’s small steps might affect. She also addressed why companies and businesses are compelled to adapt to the Net-Zero initiatives and went on to further explain it as there are some government regulations and mandates for power consumptions. There are supply chain mandates i.e., customer mandates and investor mandates for being e-friendly. The competitive pressure also forces them to adopt the Net-Zero initiative.</p>
                            <p>Also, she talked about the states adopting the Net-zero initiative. She answered all the questions enthusiastically. From her career journey we get to learn that facing challenges and finding a proper solution on our own is an integral part in the way of success, as she took her challenges as opportunities.</p>
                            <p>Ms. Bhatia’s talk was truly inspiring, bringing to light for all the young and budding attendees the fact that Climate change requires innovative ways to be combated. Attendees were exhilarated after the talk, and looked forward to implementing Net-zero ideology.</p>

In order to motivate and develop all the excellent young females into futurepreneurs, IIC had invited Ms. Kunika Rathore, to share some invoking ideas on the same. She has been the Founder of the Unknowns Agency, and a mentor at various organizations like FICCI and Delhi University, a software engineer at Hogarth Worldwide and also has been a TEDx Speaker.</p>
